# Conch SSH CA

Conch is an SSH CA for use in AIRR sites.

## Name

The famous conch in William Golding's _Lord of the Flies_ was, according to [his daughter][shell], inspired by a shell in the Bristol Museum of Natural History.
Given that this tool is to give access to secure shells, it seemed a fitting reference.
